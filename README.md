As a teenager, I was very interested in computers and technology, and this made my life tied to computers and technology.
After a while, I tried to pursue this talent and interest professionally and try to earn money from this interest.
My whole effort is to be up-to-date, influential, and ambitious so that I can present myself in the global community of programmers.
